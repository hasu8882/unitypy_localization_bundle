# unitypy_localization_bundle

For the unity game translator 

You can extract m_name, m_id, m_localization(scripts) within localization-string-tables-english(en)_assets_all.bundle using export_csv.py

Also you can edit csv using google spreadsheet etc. 
Note that the translation should be on the third line. You should copy the original text on the fourth line for translation reference.

Reformat csv using notepad++ etc, otherwise an error will occur.
